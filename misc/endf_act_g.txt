This evaluated data file is based on a software system built      
around the nuclear model code TALYS [kon23], version 2.0. It is   
part of a large collection of isotopic evaluations, all created by
running the system with either adjusted or default input          
parameters. This means that the data in the entire collection have
been tested in detail for many isotopes against individual        
experimental data, while for other isotopes it is only as good as 
the global quality of TALYS at the moment. The mutual quality of  
all individual data files is however consistent: The same set of  
nuclear models is used and, equally important, the same ENDF-6    
formatting procedures for each isotope. The data file has been    
created automatically using the ENDF-6 format generator TEFAL.    
                                                                  
The resulting data file provides a complete representation of     
nuclear data needed for transport, activation, damage, heating,   
radioactivity, and shielding applications over the incident       
proton energy range from 0.001 to 200. MeV.                       
                                                                  
All transport and activation data for neutrons, charged particles,
photons and residual nuclides are filed. This includes cross      
sections, angular distributions, double-differential spectra,     
isomeric production, discrete and continuum photon production     
cross sections, residual production cross sections and recoils.   
This general purpose evaluation can thus be used as both          
transport and activation library.                                 
                                                                  
A complete set of covariance data is included, which is stored    
in MF31-40.

TALYS is a computer code system for the prediction and analysis   
of nuclear reactions. TALYS simulates reactions that involve      
neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and    
alpha-particles, in the 1 keV - 200 MeV energy range. This is     
achieved by implementing a suite of nuclear reaction models into  
a single code system. This nuclear data file is based on a        
theoretical analysis that utilizes the optical model, compound    
nucleus statistical theory, fission, direct reactions and         
pre-equilibrium processes, in combination with databases and      
models for nuclear structure. The following output of TALYS is    
stored in this data file:                                         
                                                                  
- Total, elastic and non-elastic cross sections                   
- Inelastic cross sections to discrete states                     
- Exclusive channel cross sections, e.g. (n,g), (n,2n), (n,np),.. 
- Inelastic scattering angular distributions to discrete states   
- Exclusive channel energy spectra                                
- Exclusive channel double-differential spectra                   
- Exclusive gamma production for discrete states and continuum    
- Elastic scattering angular distributions                        
- Recoil data                                                     
- Total particle cross sections, e.g. (p,xn), (p,xp),..           
- Total particle energy spectra                                   
- Total particle double-differential spectra                      
- Isomeric and ground state cross sections                        
- Residual production cross sections                              
                                                                  
For a description of the used nuclear models and their            
parameterization we refer to [kon19]. If for this specific        
nuclide we deviate from the global parameterization, it is made   
explicit above under Nuclide Specific Information.

##### MF1: GENERAL INFORMATION

- MT451    : Descriptive data and directory
  
This text and the full directory of used MF/MT sections.

##### MF3: REACTION CROSS SECTIONS

All the data present in the following MT-sections have been 
calculated with TALYS. If the maximal cross section in an 
excitation function over the whole energy range does not exceed
1.e-9 b, the MT-number is not included at all. Cross sections 
lower than 1.e-20 b are assumed to have no physical meaning and
are set to zero.  

- MT5      : (p,anything) cross section 

MT5 contains the total non-elastic cross section, with which the
information of MF6/MT5 can be combined to obtain residual
production cross sections.

##### MF6: PRODUCT ENERGY-ANGLE DISTRIBUTIONS

In MF6 we store all residual production cross sections. 

- MT5      : (p,anything) yields 
                                                                 
MT5 contains the production yields of residual products.
The residual production yields are given per final product.
These yields can be multiplied with the cross sections given in
MF3/MT5 to get the residual production cross sections.
