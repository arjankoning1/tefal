This evaluated data file is based on a software system built      
around the nuclear model code TALYS [kon23], version 2.0. It is   
part of a large collection of isotopic evaluations, all created by
running the system with either adjusted or default input          
parameters. This means that the data in the entire collection have
been tested in detail for many isotopes against individual        
experimental data, while for other isotopes it is only as good as 
the global quality of TALYS at the moment. The mutual quality of  
all individual data files is however consistent: The same set of  
nuclear models is used and, equally important, the same ENDF-6    
formatting procedures for each isotope. The data file has been    
created automatically using the ENDF-6 format generator TEFAL.    
                                                                  
The resulting data file provides a complete representation of     
nuclear data needed for transport, activation, damage, heating,   
radioactivity, and shielding applications over the incident       
neutron energy range from 1.e-11 to 200. MeV.                     
                                                                  
All transport and activation data for neutrons, charged particles,
photons and residual nuclides are filed. This includes cross      
sections, angular distributions, double-differential spectra,     
isomeric production, discrete and continuum photon production     
cross sections, residual production cross sections and recoils.   
This general purpose evaluation can thus be used as both          
transport and activation library.                                 
                                                                  
A complete set of covariance data is included, which is stored    
in MF31-40.

TALYS is a computer code system for the prediction and analysis   
of nuclear reactions. TALYS simulates reactions that involve      
neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and    
alpha-particles, in the 1 keV - 200 MeV energy range. This is     
achieved by implementing a suite of nuclear reaction models into  
a single code system. This nuclear data file is based on a        
theoretical analysis that utilizes the optical model, compound    
nucleus statistical theory, fission, direct reactions and         
pre-equilibrium processes, in combination with databases and      
models for nuclear structure. The following output of TALYS is    
stored in this data file:                                         
                                                                  
- Total, elastic and non-elastic cross sections                   
- Inelastic cross sections to discrete states                     
- Exclusive channel cross sections, e.g. (n,g), (n,2n), (n,np),.. 
- Inelastic scattering angular distributions to discrete states   
- Exclusive channel energy spectra                                
- Exclusive channel double-differential spectra                   
- Exclusive gamma production for discrete states and continuum    
- Elastic scattering angular distributions                        
- Recoil data                                                     
- Total particle cross sections, e.g. (n,xn), (n,xp),..           
- Total particle energy spectra                                   
- Total particle double-differential spectra                      
- Isomeric and ground state cross sections                        
- Residual production cross sections                              
                                                                  
For a description of the used nuclear models and their
parameterization we refer to [kon19]. If for this specific
nuclide we deviate from the global parameterization, it is made
explicit above under Nuclide Specific Information.

This text and the full directory of used MF/MT sections.          
                                                                  
##### MF3: REACTION CROSS SECTIONS                                
                                                                  
All the data present in the following MT-sections have been       
calculated with TALYS, possibly normalized to experimental data.  
If the maximal cross section in an excitation function over the   
whole energy range does not exceed 1.e-9 b, the MT-number is not  
included. Cross sections lower than 1.e-20 b are assumed to have  
no physical meaning and are set to zero. All MT numbers extend up 
to the highest incident energy.                                   
The following reaction channels/MT numbers are generally included:

Calculated with the optical model over the whole energy range,    
or partly reproduced using experimental data.

Obtained by subtracting the non-elastic cross section from the    
total cross section.

Calculated with the optical model over the whole energy range.

MT5 contains the reactions which can not be stored in any other   
MT-number. The information of MF3/MT5 can be combined with        
MF6/MT5 to obtain residual production cross sections particle     
production cross sections and (double-)differential cross         
sections.

##### MF6: PRODUCT ENERGY-ANGLE DISTRIBUTIONS                     
                                                                  
In MF6 we store all residual production cross sections.

- MT5      : (n,anything) yields

For reactions not given by explicit MT numbers, MT5 contains the
residual production yields per final product. All these yields
and relative distributions can be multiplied with the cross
sections given in MF3/MT5 to get the production cross sections.
                                                                  
##### MF8: RADIOACTIVE DECAY DATA                                 
                                                                  
For reactions to isomers, MF8 designates where the information    
for isomeric versus ground state production, or residual          
production can be found, i.e. for each MT number it points to     
either MF6, MF9 or MF10.                                          
                                                                  
##### MF9: MULTIPLICITIES FOR PRODUCTION OF RADIOACTIVE NUCLIDES  
                                                                  
MF9 is used for isomer production by non-threshold reactions.     
Final states with a lifetime that exceeds 1 second are treated    
as isomer.                                                        
                                                                  
##### MF10: CROSS SECTIONS FOR PRODUCTION OF RADIOACTIVE NUCLIDES 
                                                                  
MF10 is used for isomer production by threshold reactions.        
Final states with a lifetime that exceeds 1 second are treated    
as isomer.                                                        
                                                                  
##### MF33: COVARIANCES OF NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS                 
                                                                  
In MF33, we store the covariances of most, but not all, reaction  
channels that are given in MF3. All covariances are generated     
with the TASMAN code [kon19], which generates TALYS runs using    
a Monte Carlo parameter method.                                   
For each MT-number, the information consists of:                  
1. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Ea (variances)                
2. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Eb (correlations for the      
   same reaction channel between different energies)              
3. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Ea (correlations between      
   different reaction channels for the same energy)               
4. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Eb (correlations between      
   different reaction channels for different energies)            
Classes 1 and 2 are covered by NI-type subsubsections with        
flag LB=5, followed by a LB=8 section which contains              
the cross section variances multiplied by 1.e-3. Next, classes 3  
and 4 are covered by flag LB=6 to account for the different       
energy grids that two correlating MT-sections may have. Since     
the total correlation matrix is fully symmetric, we only need to  
include the correlation elements between different MT-numbers     
once, and we do that in the subsection with the lowest of the     
two MT-numbers. We include covariance information for all the     
total cross sections, the lumped partial cross sections and the   
individual inelastic cross sections per level (MT51,...). We do   
not include covariances for MT600 and higher MT-numbers. For the  
most important channels, we include cross-channel correlations.   
                                                                  
##### MF40: COVARIANCES OF ISOMER PRODUCTION                      
                                                                  
For covariances of ground state and isomeric cross sections, the  
same procedures as for MF33 are used.
