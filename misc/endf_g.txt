This evaluated data file is based on a software system built      
around the nuclear model code TALYS [kon23], version 2.0. It is   
part of a large collection of isotopic evaluations, all created by
running the system with either adjusted or default input          
parameters. This means that the data in the entire collection have
been tested in detail for many isotopes against individual        
experimental data, while for other isotopes it is only as good as 
the global quality of TALYS at the moment. The mutual quality of  
all individual data files is however consistent: The same set of  
nuclear models is used and, equally important, the same ENDF-6    
formatting procedures for each isotope. The data file has been    
created automatically using the ENDF-6 format generator TEFAL.    
                                                                  
The resulting data file provides a complete representation of     
nuclear data needed for transport, activation, damage, heating,   
radioactivity, and shielding applications over the incident       
photon energy range from 1. to 200. MeV.                          
                                                                  
All transport and activation data for neutrons, charged particles,
photons and residual nuclides are filed. This includes cross      
sections, angular distributions, double-differential spectra,     
isomeric production, discrete and continuum photon production     
cross sections, residual production cross sections and recoils.   
This general purpose evaluation can thus be used as both          
transport and activation library.                                 
                                                                  
A complete set of covariance data is included, which is stored    
in MF31-40.

TALYS is a computer code system for the prediction and analysis   
of nuclear reactions. TALYS simulates reactions that involve      
neutrons, gamma-rays, protons, deuterons, tritons, helions and    
alpha-particles, in the 1 keV - 200 MeV energy range. This is     
achieved by implementing a suite of nuclear reaction models into  
a single code system. This nuclear data file is based on a        
theoretical analysis that utilizes the optical model, compound    
nucleus statistical theory, fission, direct reactions and         
pre-equilibrium processes, in combination with databases and      
models for nuclear structure. The following output of TALYS is    
stored in this data file:

All the data present in the following MT-sections have been       
calculated with TALYS, possibly normalized to experimental data.  
If the maximal cross section in an excitation function over the   
whole energy range does not exceed 1.e-9 b, the MT-number is not  
included. Cross sections lower than 1.e-20 b are assumed to have  
no physical meaning and are set to zero. All MT numbers extend up 
to the highest incident energy.                                   
The following reaction channels/MT numbers are generally included:

Obtained by integrating the "nuclear-plus-interference" angular   
distributions of MF=6.  Note that because of the interference     
effect, the tabulations in both MF=6 and MF=3 can be negative at  
some energies and angles.

##### MF6: PRODUCT ENERGY-ANGLE DISTRIBUTIONS                     
                                                                  
In MF6 we store all secondary energy, angle, and energy-angle     
distributions, as well as all residual and discrete + continuum   
photon production cross sections for channels other than capture  
(MT102) and reactions to discrete levels (MT51,etc.).             
All data are generated with TALYS.                                
                                                                  
- MT5      : (g,anything) yields and energy-angle distributions   
                                                                  
MT5 contains, in this order,                                      
For neutrons up to alpha particles and photons:                   
- the production yields per particle for the whole energy range   
- the secondary energy-angle distributions per particles which are
  not represented by explicit MT numbers. On a secondary energy   
  grid the relative emission spectra are given together with the  
  parameters for the Kalbach systematics for angular              
  distributions. Inelastic scattering cross sections for discrete 
  states have been broadened and added to the continuum spectra.  
For each residual product:                                        
- the production yields for the whole energy range.               
- the recoil                                                      
These distributions can be multiplied with MF3/MT5 to get         
the production cross sections and (double-)differential cross     
sections.                                                         
                                                                  
- MT16     : (g,2n) energy-angle distr. and photon production     
                                                                  
First, for each type of outgoing particle, the (trivial) integer  
particle yields are given. Next, on a sufficiently dense incident 
energy grid the secondary energy-angle distributions are          
specified by means of the relative emission spectra and the       
parameters for the Kalbach systematics for angular distributions. 
Next, the photon yield is tabulated as a function of incident     
energy. For each incident energy, the photon production is given  
for all discrete gamma lines present in the final nucleus. A      
continuum photon distribution is added to this. We assume         
isotropy for all produced gamma rays.                             
                                                                  
For the following MT-numbers, the same procedure as for MT16 is   
followed:                                                         
                                                                  
- MT17 : (g,3n) energy-angle distr. and photon production         
- MT22 : (g,na) energy-angle distr. and photon production         
- MT28 : (g,np) energy-angle distr. and photon production         
- MT91 : (g,n') continuum energy-angle distr. and phot. prod.

- MT809: (g,h) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.     
- MT849: (g,a) continuum energy-angle distr. and photon prod.

For reactions to isomers, MF8 designates where the information    
for isomeric versus ground state production, or residual          
production can be found, i.e. for each MT number it points to     
either MF6, MF9 or MF10.

MF9 is used for isomer production by non-threshold reactions.     
Final states with a lifetime that exceeds 1 second are treated    
as isomer.

MF10 is used for isomer production by threshold reactions.

as isomer.                                                        
                                                                  
##### MF33: COVARIANCES OF NEUTRON CROSS SECTIONS                 
                                                                  
In MF33, we store the covariances of most, but not all, reaction  
channels that are given in MF3. All covariances are generated     
with the TASMAN code [kon19], which generates TALYS runs using    
a Monte Carlo parameter method.                                   
For each MT-number, the information consists of:                  
1. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Ea (variances)                
2. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTa, Eb (correlations for the      
   same reaction channel between different energies)              
3. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Ea (correlations between      
   different reaction channels for the same energy)               
4. Covariances for MTa, Ea and MTb, Eb (correlations between      
   different reaction channels for different energies)            
Classes 1 and 2 are covered by NI-type subsubsections with        
flag LB=5, followed by a LB=8 section which contains              
the cross section variances multiplied by 1.e-3. Next, classes 3  
and 4 are covered by flag LB=6 to account for the different       
energy grids that two correlating MT-sections may have. Since     
the total correlation matrix is fully symmetric, we only need to  
include the correlation elements between different MT-numbers     
once, and we do that in the subsection with the lowest of the     
two MT-numbers. We include covariance information for all the     
total cross sections, the lumped partial cross sections and the   
individual inelastic cross sections per level (MT51,...). We do   
not include covariances for MT600 and higher MT-numbers. For the  
most important channels, we include cross-channel correlations.   
                                                                  
##### MF40: COVARIANCES OF ISOMER PRODUCTION                      
                                                                  
For covariances of ground state and isomeric cross sections, the  
same procedures as for MF33 are used.
