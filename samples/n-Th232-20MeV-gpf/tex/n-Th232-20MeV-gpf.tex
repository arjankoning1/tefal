\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 20 MeV neutron general purpose file for ${}^{232}$Th}\newline
The following {\em talys.inp} is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Th232-20MeV-gpf/org/talys.inp}

with which we run

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

For this sample case, we introduce some data from other libraries.
The following TEFAL input file is used

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Th232-20MeV-gpf/org/tefal.inp}

with which we run

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline
\end{samplecase}
