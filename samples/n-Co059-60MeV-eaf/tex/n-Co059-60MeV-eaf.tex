\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 60 MeV neutron EAF activation file for ${}^{59}$Co}\newline
This sample case concerns a high-energy neutron activation library in EAF
format. Files like this are adopted in the EAF library for
activation/transmutation calculations.
The following TALYS input file is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Co059-60MeV-eaf/org/talys.inp}

with which we run

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

The following TEFAL input file is used

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Co059-60MeV-eaf/org/tefal.inp}

with which we run

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline

Note that this time the produced nuclear data file automatically got
the extension '.eaf', {\em n-Co059.eaf}.
\end{samplecase}
