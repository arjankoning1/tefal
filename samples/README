                    SAMPLE CASES FOR TEFAL

This directory contains sample cases.
Every sample case has its own directory with a descriptive name, and contains 
a subdirectory org/ with input files and OUR calculated results. For this, 
we used the gfortran compiler on MacOS. There is also a subdirectory new/ which, 
when you receive this, contains only the input files.
By running the script 'verify', the sample cases are executed one by one 
and the new/ subdirectories are filled with YOUR calculated results. 

To run all sample cases, give
verify
To only run the first e.g. 2 sample case, give
verify 2

There should be no, or at most small, numerical differences between the results 
in new/ and those in org/. These differences are written to file 'outputdiff' in
each new/ directory.
Running the total test set will probably take less than an hour.
The calculated information of interest is in the output file (called 'tefal.out') 
or in the produced ENDF file.

The sample cases also contain a subdirectory tex/ with a description for the
TEFAL tutorial. 

Consult the manual for the meaning of all the used keywords and a description 
of all the sample cases.
