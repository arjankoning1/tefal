\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 60 MeV alpha activation file for ${}^{38}$Ar}\newline
This sample case concerns a high-energy alpha activation library in ENDF-6
format.
The following {\em talys.inp} is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples a-Ar038-60MeV-acf/org/talys.inp}

with which we run

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

The following TEFAL input file is used

\VerbatimInput{\samples a-Ar038-60MeV-acf/org/tefal.inp}

with which we run

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline

and a library 'a-Ar038.acf' is produced.
\end{samplecase}
