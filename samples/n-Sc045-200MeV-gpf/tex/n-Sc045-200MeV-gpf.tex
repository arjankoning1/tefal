\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 200 MeV neutron general purpose file for ${}^{45}$Sc}\newline
This sample case concerns a neutron data library up to an energy of 200 MeV,
and leads to the $^{45}$Sc evaluation as present in JEFF-3.1.

First, a TALYS calculation is performed \newline

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

where the input file {\em talys.inp} looks as follows:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Sc045-200MeV-gpf/org/talys.inp}

This time, the TEFAL input file {\em tefal.inp} is not empty, but
we ask for adoption of the
ENDF/B-VII total cross sections between 101 keV and 8.8 MeV, and the
resonance parameters from JENDL5.0. Moreover, we want to call our
ENDF-6 file {\em Sc45.high}.
The following input file is used

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Sc045-200MeV-gpf/org/tefal.inp}

with which we run TEFAL

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline

For the same sample case we add an alternative input file
which produces a different library {\em Sc45.alt}, namely one where there is no abrupt switch at 20 MeV, but where instead al MT numbers are filled with data up to 200 MeV.
The file {\em tefal2.inp} that takes care of this looks as follows:

\VerbatimInput{\samples n-Sc045-200MeV-gpf/org/tefal2.inp}

with which we can also run TEFAL

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal2.inp $>$ tefal2.out}\newline

to produce the {\em Sc45.alt} file.

\end{samplecase}
