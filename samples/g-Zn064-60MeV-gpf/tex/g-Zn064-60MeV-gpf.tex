\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 60 MeV gamma general purpose file for ${}^{64}$Zn}\newline
This sample case concerns a high-energy photon data library, i.e. up to an
energy of 60 MeV. Again, no attempt was made to adjust the TALYS results to
experimental data. This is a so called ``blind'' data library.
The following {\em talys.inp} is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples g-Zn064-60MeV-gpf/org/talys.inp}

with which we run

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

The following TEFAL input file is used

\VerbatimInput{\samples g-Zn064-60MeV-gpf/org/tefal.inp}

with which we run

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline
\end{samplecase}
