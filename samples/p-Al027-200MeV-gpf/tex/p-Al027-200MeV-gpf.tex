\begin{samplecase}
{\bf 200 MeV proton general purpose file for ${}^{27}$Al}\newline
This sample case concerns a high-energy proton data library, i.e. up to an
energy of 200 MeV. This time, no attempt was made to adjust the TALYS results to
experimental data. This is a so called ``blind'' data library.
The following TALYS input file is used:

\VerbatimInput{\samples p-Al027-200MeV-gpf/org/talys.inp}

with which we run

{\bf talys $<$ talys.inp $>$ talys.out}\newline

while {\em tefal.inp} is empty, so that running

{\bf tefal $<$ tefal.inp $>$ tefal.out}\newline

produces the file {\em p-Al027.gpf}.
\end{samplecase}
